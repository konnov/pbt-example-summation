# Property-Based Testing for Summation

This repository contains a very simple example of testing a summation function
using property-based testing and model checking. This experiment is inspired by
the talk on [The lazy programmer's guide to writing thousands of
tests][scott-pbt] by [Scott Wlaschin][].
